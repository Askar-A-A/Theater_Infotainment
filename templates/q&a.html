                What is the dress code for performances?
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                While there is no strict dress code, evening wear is customary and appreciated. Many guests choose formal attire: suits or tuxedos for gentlemen and evening dresses or elegant pantsuits for ladies. We recommend avoiding overly casual clothing out of respect for the performers and other guests.

            <div class="answer">
                We recommend arriving at least 30 minutes before the performance begins. This allows time for parking, coat check, finding your seat, and settling in. The doors typically open 60 minutes before curtain time. Please note that latecomers may not be admitted until a suitable break in the performance.
